The pawns lay dead on the sidelines,
Some knights are shattered and cracked.
The bishop has been beheaded,
There is no going back.

A white rook lays in ruins,
Her beautiful spires all fell,
The black queen cries out in agony,
The squares are plains of Hell. 

Another pawn steps forward,
The black knight leaps aside,
The king is back in his corner,
There's no place left to hide.

The gods above them laugh and jest
With their warmongering minds alight,
Their deft hands urge the armies on
With victory in their sight. 

The white queen dodges the bishop,
Darting behind a pawn,
The bishop makes his way over, 
But the queen is long since gone. 

The black knight presses onward, 
He sees the white king cower,
Soon be their victory, 
Soon shall be their hour. 

The white queen holds her corner,
The black king in her sight,
This is her kingdom's final stand,
It is their greatest fight. 

The black knight and his cohorts
Raise their onyx swords
The white queen and her company
Charge across the board

The kings both duck in corners
They draw their breath once more,
But the Gods then call a stalemate,
And at last, they end the war.
